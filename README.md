#CNN-MNSIT dataset Classification

* MNSIT: This is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been studied so much that it is often called the “hello world” of Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later.
The classification tasks are demonstrated using both Tensorflow and SK learn libraries.

* Fashion MNIST, which is a drop-in replacement of MNIST. It has the exact same format as MNIST (70,000 grayscale images of 28 × 28 pixels each, with 10 classes), but the images represent fashion items rather than handwritten digits, so each class is more diverse, and the problem turns out to be significantly more challenging than MNIST. For example, a simple linear model reaches about 92% accuracy on MNIST, but only about 83% on Fashion MNIST.
